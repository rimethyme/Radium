The west room is an opulent sitting room, with plush chairs and a large fireplace. 

The room is decorated with expensive tapestries and golden candelabras. 

A large painting of Valthor hangs above the fireplace, his eyes seeming to follow you as you move.

You investigate the painting and find a hidden switch.

Do you wish to go back or confront the final apprentice?
