You enter into an observatory, with large windows offering a view of the dark, stormy sky. 

Various magical instruments and star charts are scattered around the room, and a large telescope points towards the heavens. 

This is where Valthor studies the stars and the forces of nature.

You see him looking out the vast window.

Do you wish to go back or to confront him?
