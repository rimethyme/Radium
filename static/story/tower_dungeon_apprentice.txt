You quickly free the apprentice and tell him of your plan to fight Valthor.

"Because you've freed him, I will give you a powerful weapon to help you, and I will show you the secret entrance to the second floor. You will have to defeat the other apprentices to advance up the tower as they guard Valthor most loyally."

You eagerly accept his help, and he asks if you wish to go to the secret entrance now or if you wish to do something else on the first floor.
