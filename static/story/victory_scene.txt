With Valthor defeated, his dark influence over the land begins to fade. 

The sky clears, and the sun shines brightly for the first time in what feels like an eternity. 

You make your way back to the village where the people greet you as a hero. 

Peace has been restored, thanks to your bravery and determination.

THE END
