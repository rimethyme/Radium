The west room is a meditation chamber, filled with soft cushions and surrounded by glowing crystals. 

The room is designed to enhance concentration and focus for those practicing their magical arts. 

In the center of the room, a small fountain bubbles with clear, magical water.

You find a greater health potion tucked under one of the cushions.
