The west room is a study with a large wooden desk and numerous bookshelves. The desk is cluttered with scrolls and papers, and a small window lets in a shaft of light.

You search around and find a secret entrance from moving one of the books. Classic! 

You can either go back or go forth to the apprentice of this floor.
