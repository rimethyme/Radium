You stand at the base of the ominous Tower of Valthor. The sky above is a swirling mass of dark clouds, and a chilling wind whispers through the surrounding trees. You know that within this tower lies the source of the terror that has plagued the nearby villages, including your own.

To the north, a dense, creepy forest stretches out, its dark canopy blocking out most of the light. To the west, you see the edge of a marsh, with stagnant water and overgrown vegetation. To the east, you see a ruined guardhouse. The road back to the village lies to the south.
